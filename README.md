# Earthquake Risk Zoning and Temporary Shelter Mapping using GIS

## Project Overview
This project focuses on earthquake risk assessment and temporary shelter location mapping in **District 3 of Tehran**. Given the unpredictable nature of earthquakes, proactive planning is essential for disaster management. The study integrates **GIS-based analysis** with **spatial data** to identify high-risk zones and determine suitable locations for temporary shelters after an earthquake.

## Methodology
The project is divided into two main phases:

### 1. **Earthquake Risk Zoning**
Utilizing **ArcPy**, the risk zoning map was generated based on the following criteria:
- **Distance from fault lines**
- **Distance from high-density areas**
- **Distance from fuel stations**
- **Distance from power transmission lines**

These parameters were processed using **Boolean logic**, with Euclidean distances calculated where applicable.

### 2. **Temporary Shelter Site Selection**
A suitability map for **post-earthquake temporary shelters** was generated by integrating:
- **Output from the earthquake risk zoning map** (avoiding high-risk zones)
- **Distance from hospitals**
- **Distance from fire stations**
- **Distance from road networks**

Fuzzy logic (**S-Shaped & Z-Shaped membership functions**) was applied to assign suitability scores, and **Simplified Decision Rules** were used to classify areas. A final **defuzzification** process produced the classified output.

## Implementation
- **GIS Processing**: Performed in ArcMap with spatial analysis techniques.
- **Automated Processing**: Developed an **ArcPy-based** tool that accepts **Shapefile inputs** and generates an earthquake risk zoning map automatically.

## Results
- A **classified earthquake risk map** highlighting hazardous areas.
- A **temporary shelter location map** ensuring optimal placement of emergency shelters.
- A **Python-based GIS tool** that streamlines the risk zoning process.

## Technologies Used
- **ArcMap (GIS Analysis)**
- **Python (ArcPy scripting for automation)**
- **Boolean Logic & Fuzzy Logic for Spatial Analysis**

## How to Use
1. Provide input **Shapefiles** for the study area.
2. Run the **ArcPy-based script**.
3. Obtain the **risk zoning map** and **shelter suitability map**.
